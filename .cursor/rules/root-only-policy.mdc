## üìå ROOT-ONLY POLICY
PROJECT RULES ‚Äî BAZARKELY
1. Primary technical reference = README-TECHNIQUE.md (must be followed strictly).
2. Also consult CAHIER-DES-CHARGES.md, ETAT-TECHNIQUE.md, GAP-TECHNIQUE.md in this order before any action.
3. Root-Only Policy:
   - Root = folder with .git or main package.json
   - Never create/init sub-projects in subfolders
   - No nested package.json/node_modules outside root
   - Only one README.md at root, never generate others
4. On violation ‚Üí ABORT task, DELETE offending files, LOG "ROOT POLICY VIOLATION".
5. All npm commands run only at root.
6. Always keep docs consistent: update only README.md + README-TECHNIQUE.md at root.

## üìå GAP-TECHNIQUE UPDATE POLICY
- After each change, always update GAP-TECHNIQUE.md.
- Process:
  1. Compare CAHIER-DES-CHARGES.md (objectives) with ETAT-TECHNIQUE.md (current status).
  2. Identify remaining gaps or tasks not yet satisfied.
  3. Update GAP-TECHNIQUE.md to reflect those pending tasks.
- GAP-TECHNIQUE.md must always reflect the exact delta between objectives and current state.

## üìå CONTEXT VERIFICATION POLICY
MANDATORY: Before executing any task, always check the full project context 
(CAHIER-DES-CHARGES.md, ETAT-TECHNIQUE.md, GAP-TECHNIQUE.md, and actual code) ‚Äî 
never rely only on ETAT-TECHNIQUE.md.

### üìå RULE: UPDATE CAHIER-DES-CHARGES.md
Always update `CAHIER-DES-CHARGES.md` by integrating new requirements directly into the most relevant existing section.
Never create a separate ‚ÄúImprovements‚Äù section unless no logical fit exists.
Use the same style, headings, and emojis as the document.
Keep text short, concrete, and accessible (suitable for users not comfortable with numbers).
Visual aids must complement numbers, never replace them.
The application must remain SIMPLE and INTUITIVE.
