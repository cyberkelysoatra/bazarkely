# BazarKELY Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

BazarKELY is now configured for Netlify deployment with proper PWA support and React Router handling.

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Files Created
- `netlify.toml` - Main Netlify configuration
- `frontend/public/_redirects` - Client-side routing support
- `frontend/dist/` - Production build (ready for deployment)

### ✅ Build Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ All assets generated with proper hashes
- ✅ PWA files created (manifest.webmanifest, sw.js)
- ✅ Service worker registered

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### 1. netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  command = "cd frontend && npm run build"
  publish = "frontend/dist"
  functions = "netlify/functions"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
  NODE_ENV = "production"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

# Security and PWA headers configured
```

### 2. _redirects
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

## 🚀 Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Netlify CLI (Recommended)

1. **Install Netlify CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify**
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

3. **Initialize Site**
   ```bash
   cd D:\bazarkely-2
   netlify init
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

### Method 2: Drag & Drop (Quick Test)

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Login to your account
3. Drag the `frontend/dist` folder to the deploy area
4. Your site will be live instantly!

### Method 3: Git Integration (Production)

1. **Connect Repository**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub/GitLab repository

2. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Build command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/dist`
   - Node version: 20

3. **Deploy**
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy on every push

## 🔐 Environment Variables

If you need environment variables:

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to Site Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add your variables (e.g., VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)

2. **In netlify.toml:**
   ```toml
   [build.environment]
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL = "your-supabase-url"
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your-supabase-key"
   ```

## 🌐 Domain Configuration

### Custom Domain
1. Go to Site Settings → Domain Management
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as instructed
4. Enable HTTPS (automatic with Netlify)

### Subdomain
- Netlify provides: `your-site-name.netlify.app`
- Custom subdomain: `bazarkely.your-domain.com`

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Basic Functionality
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] All pages accessible (dashboard, accounts, transactions, etc.)
- [ ] React Router works (direct URL access)
- [ ] PWA features work (install prompt, offline mode)

### 2. PWA Verification
- [ ] Manifest loads: `https://your-site.netlify.app/manifest.webmanifest`
- [ ] Service worker active: Check DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- [ ] Install prompt appears on mobile
- [ ] Offline functionality works

### 3. Performance Check
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90
- [ ] All assets load correctly
- [ ] No 404 errors in console

## 🧪 Local Testing Commands

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
# 1. Build the project
cd D:\bazarkely-2\frontend
npm run build

# 2. Test the build locally
npm run preview

# 3. Test PWA features
# Open http://localhost:4173 in Chrome
# Check DevTools → Application → Manifest
# Check DevTools → Application → Service Workers

# 4. Test routing
# Try accessing: http://localhost:4173/dashboard
# Should load without 404 errors
```

## 🔄 Differences from OVH Deployment

| Aspect | OVH | Netlify |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **Configuration** | `.htaccess` files | `netlify.toml` + `_redirects` |
| **Build Process** | Manual upload | Automatic from Git |
| **SSL** | Manual setup | Automatic |
| **CDN** | Basic | Global CDN |
| **Redirects** | Apache mod_rewrite | Netlify redirects |
| **Headers** | Apache headers | Netlify headers |
| **Deployment** | FTP/SFTP upload | Git push or CLI |
| **Rollbacks** | Manual | One-click |
| **Preview** | No | Branch previews |

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **404 on Direct URL Access**
   - Check `_redirects` file is in `frontend/public/`
   - Verify redirect rules in `netlify.toml`

2. **PWA Not Working**
   - Check manifest.webmanifest is accessible
   - Verify service worker registration
   - Check HTTPS is enabled

3. **Build Failures**
   - Check Node version (should be 20)
   - Verify all dependencies installed
   - Check build logs in Netlify dashboard

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure variables start with `VITE_`
   - Check they're set in Netlify dashboard
   - Rebuild after adding variables

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check build locally
cd D:\bazarkely-2\frontend
npm run build

# Test redirects
curl -I https://your-site.netlify.app/dashboard

# Check PWA
curl https://your-site.netlify.app/manifest.webmanifest
```

## 📊 Performance Optimization
